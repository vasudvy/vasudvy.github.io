  <h3>Fractured Identity</h3><br><br>
  <p>Of all emotions a human could fathom or possess, I believe guilt is the sole cause of suffering. And those who believe they are in guilt of something, they feel they deserve to be suffered. Suffering is very personal. You know you fucked up somewhere a long time ago and now you cannot unfuck what has been fucked. Externally it may seem to people that you are troubled because of some work, some dispute, some thing - but of all folks in this world, only you know what it is.<br><br>

Trust me on this, it is very easy to runaway from people but you cannot runaway from yourself. If you don't learn to live with yourself it will become very difficult to live this life.<br><br>

When I think about the fractured nature of identity, I'm reminded of Freud's psychosexual development theory - though modern psychology has largely abandoned this framework. Freud believed our personality develops through five distinct stages: the Oral stage (0-1 years) where pleasure is derived through the mouth, sucking and biting; the Anal stage (1-3 years) where control and pleasure come from bowel movements and toilet training; the Phallic stage (3-6 years) where children discover their genitals and develop unconscious sexual desires for the opposite-sex parent; the Latency stage (6-puberty) where sexual feelings are dormant and children focus on developing skills and friendships; and finally the Genital stage (puberty onwards) where mature sexual interests emerge.<br><br>

Though contemporary psychology has moved beyond these rigid stages, what strikes me isn't their accuracy but the underlying assumption that our identity is formed through these early fragmentations of pleasure and pain, satisfaction and denial. Perhaps our sense of self was always meant to be fractured.<br><br>

I as a human have lost lots of senses till now. This world amazes me. I do not understand anything about it. Each time it feels like I am spiralled back to ground zero to understand about it one more time. A lot of disillusionment has created their house in me. My mind is accommodating them as guests. Maybe it is because of isolation, I never have ever been this alone in my life. Never been this close with myself. I have observed a lot about me till now, this solitude has given me a broader view on how my habits, behaviour and introspection has evolved over time.<br><br>

From early childhood till now, I have re-discovered a lot from memories I thought I understood well. A deep feeling of empathy has begun to take place in me, I was not like this earlier. I at times think, this is because of self pity. I think it is time for me to cannibalize on my vices and look forward at things with a lot more responsibility. I have to evolve from this, otherwise I will be lost.<br><br>

This meeting with self is what terrifies us most. It's why we seek dissociation through whatever means necessary. Some of us find it in psychedelics, watching our consciousness slip away from the edges of our awareness until we're observing ourselves from somewhere else entirely. Others find it in harder substances - cocaine that makes you feel like you're the main character in someone else's movie, or DMT that dissolve the boundaries between self and not-self so completely that you forget there was ever a self to begin with.<br><br>

Substance abuse isn't just about pleasure - it's about the desperate need to step outside the prison of your own consciousness, to experience what it feels like to not be yourself for a while. When you're high, you're watching your life happen to someone else.<br><br>

But here's what I learned: dissociation through substances is like trying to solve a puzzle by throwing the pieces in the air. Sure, for a moment you don't have to look at the incomplete picture, but when you come down, the pieces are scattered even further apart.<br><br>

I think, this is also a way I have discovered meditation. I am meditating even as of now I am writing this. <i>Dhyana</i> as it is called is dynamic for me. I let time be felt passing through me, through this mortal body of mine and I experience him. I try to be as close as possible to him viz, <i>brahma</i>. I am a mere spectator here, not the doer. I feel like I have been scammed by attachments for so long. I believed this rendered universe to be true for a long time under the compulsion of my attachments. Attachment not in term with another human being, but within myself.<br><br>

To say I am is to foul oneself. What is this internal awareness that I carry around like a badge of honour. Reader, do you think I and You are different? If yes then this is precisely what I am talking about. Our difference only exists till our mind, beyond that we are indifferent. We are one.<br><br>

A wanderer once told me about Lord Rama. He sung a doha and announced to me - <i>"my mother is that womb, who cried was only a woman. I came out of a bag, like this, to know the brahma. O woman, who sheltered me and cried, I will kill the brahma if anyone else than me make you cry."</i> It is a very striking announcement. Think about it - I came out of a bag <i>(बोरी)</i> i.e., uterus.<br><br>

The real dissociation happens not when you're high, but when you're completely sober and suddenly realize you're watching yourself live your life. You're sitting in a room, talking to people, going through the motions, but there's this other you - the observer - who's watching it all happen with a kind of detached curiosity. Who is this person speaking? Why are they saying these things? What are they trying to prove?<br><br>

Life is a very false narrative, only death is the truth. It is certain, it will knock your door one day. This is the only certainty in the whole world. Some men or women may have intellect as their weapon, some may have their charm, cunningness, talent, craft - whatever you name it. But the world has nothing to offer more than what it already is.<br><br>

How close are you to yourself? Who are you? What is it that you are being? Is there any knowledge or is it all information that you are chasing? When will you see that there is nothing to know. You already know it. It is here, it existed before mankind was even born and it will exist even after the mankind will be gone. Like the haiku,<i> "summer grass: all that remains, of a warriors dream."</i><br><br>

Cherish the impermanence of life. Realise that it is also your father's first life, realise it is also your friend's first life. Realise that it is a tiny frame of window opened for a very less time. What you see is a client side rendering of the universe. Your soul borrows the compute from the brahman. There are over 8 million species sharing this planet and we understand the language of only one.<br><br>

Understand that when you communicate with an animal, what is that intuitive feeling, what it that intuitive interspecies communication that reflects through your soul... when did you learn it? Why did you move your eyes a certain way, how did you comprehend what other animal meant, how is animal able to respond to your intuitiveness.<br><br>

Being a gun alone never helps. If you take yourself as a mere weapon - who has calibre, capacity and conceivity - you will only be used. Become the direction, the one who points the gun. It is the target what makes the aftermath likeable, not the act of firing.<br><br>

This fracturing isn't a bug in the system - it's a feature. When we experience dissociation, when we feel like we're watching ourselves from the outside, when we question whether the person we were yesterday is the same person we are today, we're not losing our minds. We're discovering the multiplicity that was always there.<br><br>

This is all there is. Once you came out of that uterus you became aware of the brahma and encountered the brahmana. It is a very simple thing to observe and have an empirical archive of in memory. To notice for once who you are and to internalize that only way forward is through acceleration. What mankind has achieved in totality is so great and beauitful. We have to poke life. We have to touch it and make a mark upon it. Influence life to change the course of nature. Be indebted to this opportunity. Be indebted to your awareness. See it for once and attain <i>sthirtha</i> right now. This very moment. I understand your mind is chanchal thus is the nature of moh, it is very formulative, indecisiveness is its emergent property. Don't stamp your existence with moh, your life will become very limited. Instead fight with it and win over it, I say ye shall meet thyself at earliest.<br><br>

Every being is confined within the limits of its own sensory system, experiencing not the world as it is, but a filtered, species-specific version of it. A human perceives reality in colors determined by the visible light spectrum (wavelengths between 400–700 nm). A bird sees ultraviolet patterns invisible to humans, a snake detects infrared heat signatures, and a bat constructs its world through echolocation. None of these realities are false, but none are complete either.<br><br>

What we call "the world" is merely the result of a biological filtering function. If reality itself is an infinite-dimensional structure (let’s call it R), then each species experiences only a fraction of it.
Since perception is designed for survival rather than truth, each function discards vast portions of reality that are not biologically useful. <br><br>

We might assume that by combining perspectives, we get closer to full reality. If a human and a bird share their perceptions, their combined reality would be more complete than either one alone, but still only a fragment of R. Even if we extend this to all species—combining every sensory system from eagles to whales, from insects to fungi—we still do not arrive at R, the true reality. Instead, we get: <br><br>

Sum of all biological perception = S_bio (still incomplete) <br><br>

This tells us something profound: No matter how many perspectives we merge, we will never fully reconstruct reality. Even the totality of what all species combined can perceive is still an approximation, like a shadow of a higher-dimensional truth. <br><br>

If we wanted to escape these limitations, we would need to "invert" perception—to take the sum of all sensed realities and reconstruct the full R. But perception functions are lossy—they throw away information irreversibly. Just as a two-dimensional shadow cannot fully describe the three-dimensional object that cast it, our sensory experiences cannot fully describe R.<br><br>

This suggests that reality exists in a higher-order space beyond perception. Even if we extend our senses with technology—infrared cameras, X-ray telescopes, particle detectors—these are just tools that stretch our biological filters a little further. They don’t dissolve the fundamental limitation.<br><br>

<i>For every possible observer, there will always be a part of reality that remains inaccessible.</i><br><br>

No perspective, no sum of perspectives, and no technological advancement can ever fully grasp R. This does feel intuitive now to think about, but imagine pondering about these question in pre-quantum era with those outlaw copenhagen theorists like bohr, heisenberg etc. Alas we cannot, also we don't even deserve to pollute the view of men with their stature with our presence (yes i am indicating that we are disgustingly dumb in front of them).<br><br>

If all perception is just a projection of R, then no being, no matter how advanced, ever experiences the full truth. This is why reality is not a fixed, knowable object, but an ever-receding horizon. It is something we can move toward but never fully reach.<br><br>

Sum of all perspectives → R (but never reaches it)<br><br>

This is why perception is both necessary and deceptive—it gives us just enough to survive, but not enough to see things as they really are.<br><br>

> All perception is a shadow, and all reality is a projection from an unreachable dimension. <br><br>



We do not see the world as it is. We see the world as our biology allows us to. The full truth remains forever beyond our grasp—but it is in the search for that truth that meaning emerges.<br><br>

Let reality, denoted as R, exist in an infinite-dimensional space where n → ∞. Each species perceives only a subset of this reality, represented as S_i, where S_i is a projection of R filtered through the biological and cognitive constraints of that species. Mathematically, this relationship can be described by a perception function P_i, such that:<br><br>

P_i(R) = S_i <br><br>

This function is inherently lossy, meaning it discards vast amounts of information from R, leaving only a compressed, survival-relevant fraction of reality. As a consequence, the dimensionality of any species' perceptual world is strictly less than the dimensionality of full reality: <br><br>

dim(S_i) < dim(R) <br><br>

Even when multiple species' perceptions are combined, they still fail to reconstruct R in its entirety. If a human and a bird merge their sensory data, their collective perceptual world can be written as:<br><br>

S_h + S_b = S_hb

This new space S_hb is richer than either individual’s perception, yet it remains a projection of R, rather than R itself. Extending this summation to include all biological perception, we define:<br><br>

S_bio = Σ P_i(R) for all species i <br><br>

This represents the totality of all known perceptual systems. However, since perception functions are non-invertible—meaning they irreversibly discard information—attempting to reconstruct R from S_bio is impossible:<br><br>

P_i⁻¹ (S_i) ≠ R <br><br>

This guarantees that even the sum of all biological perception remains incomplete: <br><br>

S_bio ⊂ R, but S_bio ≠ R <br><br>

The question then arises: can artificial sensors and technological extensions of perception bridge the gap? If we define S_tech as the additional perceptual data gained through machines (such as infrared, X-rays, radio waves), we obtain a more expanded perceptual space: <br><br>

S_total = S_bio + S_tech

But even as technology improves indefinitely, the fundamental limitation remains. The perceptual functions that shape both biological and artificial observation are still projections of R, not R itself. Thus, the asymptotic limit of expanding knowledge is: <br><br>

lim (S_total) as tech → ∞ ≠ R <br><br>

Reality remains an unreachable boundary, a limit that perception can only approximate but never fully grasp. <br><br>

which approximates that for every possible observer, there is always a portion of reality that remains inaccessible. No matter how much we expand our senses, no matter how many perspectives we merge, the totality of R will forever remain beyond the reach of perception. Reality is not something we see—it is something we approximate, always chasing but never fully attaining the absolute truth.<br><br>


The Fundamental Mismatch Problem <br><br>

One of the most striking contradictions in human existence is the mismatch between the exponential evolution of our environment and the near-static nature of our biology. The lungs of a prehistoric human and those of a modern human are functionally identical, yet the air they breathe, the pollutants they encounter, and the lifestyle demands imposed upon them have changed drastically. This mismatch extends far beyond physiology—our cognitive functions, stress responses, and sensory systems remain largely tuned to an ancestral world, even as we navigate a reality shaped by agriculture, industrialization, and now, rapid technological acceleration. <br><br>

If we map this onto a mathematical model, we define B(t) as the function representing biological evolution over time and E(t) as the function representing environmental change. Human biology evolves on a slow, near-linear or logarithmic timescale, constrained by genetic drift and natural selection: <br><br>

B(t) ≈ c (constant over short timescales)<br><br>

In contrast, environmental evolution—driven by technological advancement, population growth, and cultural shifts—follows an exponential trajectory: <br><br>

E(t) ≈ e^t <br><br>

The difference between these two functions defines a growing mismatch over time: <br><br>

Δ(t) = E(t) - B(t)<br><br>

Initially, in prehistoric times, Δ(t) ≈ 0 because environmental demands and biological evolution were synchronized. However, as human civilization advanced through agriculture, industry, and digital technology, E(t) began outpacing B(t) at an increasing rate. The gap between what our biology was designed for and what our environment now demands has widened dramatically: <br><br>

lim (E(t) - B(t)) as t → ∞ = ∞ <br><br>

This widening delta explains many modern health crises—our bodies and minds, optimized for small tribal groups, high-activity lifestyles, and natural diets, are now forced to adapt to dense urbanization, sedentary work, ultra-processed foods, and digital overstimulation. The biological stress response, once a survival mechanism against predators, now misfires in the face of email notifications and financial pressures. Our dopamine systems, designed for intermittent rewards, are now bombarded by the hyper-stimulation of social media, leading to addiction-like behaviors.<br><br>

This mismatch has consequences beyond individual health; it shapes the very structure of societies. Political systems struggle to regulate technologies that evolve faster than governance can adapt. Education systems designed for the industrial age fail to prepare students for the digital era. Even our collective psychology is destabilized by a reality changing at speeds that outpace cognitive adaptation.<br><br>

The fundamental question, then, is whether human evolution can ever catch up with the exponential curve of E(t). Biologically, the answer is no—evolutionary change occurs over millennia, whereas technological revolutions happen in decades. The only potential resolution is not biological adaptation, but rather self-directed augmentation—the merging of biology with technology through bioengineering, neural interfaces, and AI integration.<br><br>

In essence, the future of human existence is not about catching up to environmental change but about changing the very nature of what it means to be human.<br><br>


This is also why I asked you to meet yourself as soon as possible. It is waiting for you to be discovered. Do not ignore it, listen to it. Travel as much as possible. Not because it will help you find yourself, but because it will help you lose yourself in the most beautiful way possible. The fractured identity isn't something to be healed or made whole. It's something to be understood, accepted, even celebrated. Each fragment carries its own wisdom, its own perspective, its own truth. <br><br>


Ps. All math things are attempted as an over sketch and I agree nothing is more harmful than an average maths student lest me being a retarted maths student, so don't pick on it, treat it as gliterry-pop-wannabe math literature. ciao.
