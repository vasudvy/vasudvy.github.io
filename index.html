  <h3>Vasu Dubey</h3>
  <p>Hi, I am Vasu. I work at <a href="https://sage-dodol-6a11e2.netlify.app/">os1</a> where we are helping people with speech impairment speak again using artificial intelligence and digital voice prosthesis. I enrolled for a BTech program but later dropped out after second semester. I love cinema and literature, if not working you can find me simping around red dead redemption,dark souls iii, or diablo. Here is my <a href=" https://boxd.it/Hhj94">letterboxd</a> I will put my goodreads here soon.</p>

  <p><b>Things I find interesting</b> :</p>
  <ul><b>Engineering Photosynthesis:</b> Mastering photosynthesis will be humanity's biggest win for ages to come. If you are working in this field, I would love to connect and share notes.</ul> 
  <ul><b>AI Safety:</b> AGI will be actualized by sheer will of humanity and we need to be sure that it is safe and aligned with humans.</ul>
  <ul><b>Power Systems:</b> We need more innovation across the compartments of power systems to build a sustainable future.</ul>
  <ul><b>Biology:</b> I think 21st century will change our perception around biology and I am very excited to explore that.</ul>
